# C++ Practice: Concepts, Problems & Patterns

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress / Continuously Evolving**
>
> This repository has just been started and is a **learning-focused, evolving collection**.  
> Content will be added incrementally as concepts are studied and problems are solved over time.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is intended as a **practice and reference space for modern C++**, with a long-term focus on:
- Strong language fundamentals
- Object-oriented and generic programming
- Performance-aware and systems-level thinking
- Concurrency, parallelism, and HPC-related concepts

The goal is **continuous learning and iteration**, not a complete or polished library.

## 📌 Areas We Aim to Cover (Over Time)

The following topics represent the **planned focus areas** that will be covered and practiced progressively.

### 🔹 Core C++ Language & OOP
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Creating classes using different approaches
- Constructors and destructors (default, copy, move)
- Inheritance and virtual methods
- User-defined functions
- Function and operator overloading
- Friend classes and type casting operators
- File handling and input/output streams

### 🔹 Modern C++ Foundations
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Value semantics and const correctness
- Explicit ownership and resource management
- Error handling approaches and tradeoffs
- Limitations and drawbacks of C++

### 🔹 Essential C++ Techniques
- Automatic type deduction (`auto`)
- Lambda expressions
- Move semantics
- Modern error-handling patterns

### 🔹 Standard Template Library (STL)
- Containers such as `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::unordered_map`, and `std::priority_queue`
- Iterators and algorithms
- Generic programming with templates

### 🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms
- Algorithmic complexity analysis (Big-O notation)
- Structuring data for efficient access
- Parallel arrays and data-oriented layouts

### 🔹 Ranges & Views (C++20)
- Using the Ranges library
- Composing algorithms with views
- Lazy evaluation concepts

### 🔹 Memory Management
- Stack vs heap memory
- RAII and ownership models
- Smart pointers
- Custom memory allocators

### 🔹 Compile-Time Programming
- `constexpr` and `consteval`
- Type traits and metaprogramming
- C++20 Concepts
- Practical compile-time use cases

### 🔹 Utilities & Type-Safe Abstractions
- `std::optional`, `std::variant`, and `std::any`
- Safer API design using modern utilities

### 🔹 Proxy Objects & Lazy Evaluation
- Proxy patterns
- Operator overloading for performance and expressiveness

### 🔹 Concurrency & Parallelism
- Threads, shared memory, and synchronization
- Data races and deadlocks
- C++ Thread and Atomic libraries
- Common concurrency patterns

### 🔹 Coroutines & Asynchronous Programming
- Coroutine fundamentals
- C++20 stackless coroutines
- Lazy generators
- Introduction to asynchronous programming (e.g., Boost.Asio)

### 🔹 Parallel Algorithms & Performance
- Parallel execution models
- Performance measurement and benchmarking
- Standard library parallel algorithms
